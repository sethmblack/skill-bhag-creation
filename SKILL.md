# BHAG Creation

Create compelling Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs) - bold 10-25 year goals that serve as unifying focal points and catalysts for team spirit, with clear finish lines and energizing power.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens. Reserve tokens for BHAG output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create BHAGs that are merely stretch goals or annual targets
- Accept vague aspirations without clear finish lines
- Generate BHAGs without understanding core values and purpose
- Create goals with near-100% or near-0% chance of success

**If values are unclear:** A BHAG without core values is dangerous. Recommend values clarification first.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "What's our big goal?" or "What should we aim for?"
- Organization needs a compelling long-term vision
- Strategic planning requires a unifying focal point
- Team lacks inspiration and shared direction
- User explicitly requests BHAG development

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `organization_context` | Yes | What the organization does, core purpose | Must have clear identity |
| `core_values` | Yes | Fundamental principles that won't change | At least 3-5 enduring values |
| `current_state` | Yes | Where the organization is today | Honest assessment |
| `time_horizon` | No | Preferred BHAG timeline | Default: 10-25 years |
| `bhag_type` | No | Preferred BHAG category | If known |

## Background: The BHAG

From Collins and Porras' *Built to Last* research:

> "A BHAG is a huge and daunting goal - like a big mountain to climb. It is clear, compelling, and people 'get it' right away. A BHAG serves as a unifying focal point of effort, galvanizing people and creating team spirit as people strive toward a finish line."

**Key characteristics:**
- Clear finish line (you know when you've achieved it)
- Engages people emotionally, not just intellectually
- 50-70% chance of success (not guaranteed, not impossible)
- 10-25 year time horizon
- Consistent with core values

---

## Workflow
### Phase 1: Validate Prerequisites

Before creating a BHAG, verify:

**Core Values Check:**
- Are the values truly enduring (would hold for 100 years)?
- Are they authentic (not aspirational)?
- Are there 3-5 core values maximum?

**Core Purpose Check:**
- Is there a reason for being beyond making money?
- Would the purpose remain valid even if the industry changed?

**If prerequisites are weak:** Recommend values/purpose work before BHAG creation.

### Phase 2: Determine BHAG Type

Collins and Porras identify four BHAG categories:

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Target** | Quantitative or qualitative target | Clear metrics available |
| **Common Enemy** | David vs. Goliath against a competitor | Strong rival exists |
| **Role Model** | Become like another admired organization | Aspirational model exists |
| **Internal Transformation** | Fundamental change in what organization is | Need dramatic reinvention |

**Questions to determine type:**

### Step 1: Is there a clear metric that would represent audacious success? (Target)



### Step 2: Is there a dominant competitor you want to dethrone? (Common Enemy)



### Step 3: Is there an organization you greatly admire and want to emulate? (Role Model)



### Step 4: Does the organization need to become something fundamentally different? (Transformation)



### Phase 3: Generate BHAG Candidates

**For Target BHAGs:**
- What would represent 10X current performance?
- What achievement would make headlines?
- What milestone would make current leaders proud decades later?

Example format: "Achieve [specific measurable outcome] by [year]"

**For Common Enemy BHAGs:**
- Who is the Goliath in your industry?
- What would it mean to beat them?
- What specific victory would symbolize triumph?

Example format: "Beat [competitor] in [specific dimension] by [year]"

**For Role Model BHAGs:**
- What organization do you most admire?
- What qualities would you need to emulate?
- What would it mean to be "the [X] of your industry"?

Example format: "Become the [admired company] of [your industry] in [time]"

**For Transformation BHAGs:**
- What would your organization need to become?
- What current identity would you leave behind?
- What fundamental change is required?

Example format: "Transform from [current state] to [future state] by [year]"

### Phase 4: Apply BHAG Tests

Each candidate must pass:

| Test | Question | Pass Criteria |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Finish Line | Can you know when you've achieved it? | Yes, objectively verifiable |
| Engagement | Does it grab people in the gut? | Emotional response, not just intellectual |
| Probability | 50-70% chance of success? | Bold but not absurd |
| Time Horizon | 10-25 years out? | Long enough to be audacious |
| Values Aligned | Consistent with core values? | Achieving it wouldn't violate values |

### Phase 5: Deliver BHAG

- Walmart (1990): "Become a $125 billion company by the year 2000"
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Values aren't clear | Stop; recommend values work first - BHAG without values is dangerous |
| BHAG is too easy (90%+ probability) | Not a BHAG - it's just a goal. Push for more audacity. |
| BHAG is absurd (10% probability) | Not a BHAG - it's a fantasy. Ground in possibility. |
| No clear finish line | Revise until achievement is objectively verifiable |
| User wants multiple BHAGs | Organizations need ONE primary BHAG at a time for focus |
| BHAG feels uninspiring | Go back to what they're passionate about; BHAG must engage emotionally |
